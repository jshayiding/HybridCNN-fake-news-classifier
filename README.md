Automatic fake news detection is a challenging problem in deception detection, and it has tremendous real-world political and social impacts. However, statistical approaches to battle with fake news has been dramatically limited by the lack of labeled benchmark datasets. However, in this research project, we utilized the LIAR dataset with rich meta data to build a fake news classification model that outperformed the model mentioned in the paper [William Wang et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00648) where the accuracy of the proposed model is around 27% accuracy on the test set.
